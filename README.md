## üö¶ Step-by-Step: How To Use Everything

1. **Prepare Cloud Environment**
   - Make sure you have an AWS account, CLI installed, and IAM credentials. (Reference docs provided)[1][2]
   - Create a keypair named `key`.

2. **Provision Infrastructure**
   - Go to `terraform/ec2_server/` for EC2, `terraform/eks_code/` for EKS cluster.
   - Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply --auto-approve`. This sets up servers, networks, clusters.

3. **Configure Jenkins CI/CD**
   - Install plugins (SonarQube, NodeJS, Docker, Prometheus metrics).
   - Add credentials (AWS, SonarQube token).
   - Create pipelines (use files in `pipeline_script/`). Pipelines automate these tasks:
      - Checkout code from GitHub
      - Static analysis with SonarQube
      - Vulnerability scanning with Trivy
      - Build Docker image
      - Push image to AWS ECR

4. **Containerize the App**
   - Use `Dockerfile` to build the app as a container.
   - Jenkins pipeline takes care of this automatically.

5. **Deploy to EKS with ArgoCD**
   - Use `terraform/eks_code/` to create your cluster.
   - Setup ArgoCD (follow docs in writeup and pipeline steps).
   - Sync `k8s/deployment.yaml` and `k8s/service.yaml` with ArgoCD ‚Äî app will deploy and run automatically in Kubernetes.

6. **Monitor App & Cluster**
   - Install Prometheus and Grafana (Jenkins pipeline/pipeline_script and `k8s/` manifests).
   - Access dashboards for real-time metrics, resource use, custom monitoring.

7. **Access the Application**
   - Get the LoadBalancer IP/name from the service created in EKS (`k8s/service.yaml`).
   - Visit in browser.

8. **App Management**
   - Use `access.sh` for fast management/scripts.
   - Control, test, or troubleshoot your app and cluster as needed.

9. **Cleanup Flow**
   - Use cleanup pipeline (`pipeline_script/cleanup_pipeline`).
   - Run `terraform destroy` in both `ec2_server` and `eks_code` to shut down all AWS resources.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Quality

- SonarQube ensures robust, high-quality code before deployment.
- Trivy scans for vulnerabilities in the containers.
- Credentials are securely managed within Jenkins.

***

## üìà Monitoring

- Prometheus scrapes metrics from your Kubernetes cluster.
- Grafana visualizes everything in rich dashboards‚Äîeasy for debugging & scaling.

***

## üìù Docs

- For full explanations, workflow and troubleshooting steps, open `Project_WriteUp.docx`
- Refer to tips & quick actions via `README.md` and helper scripts.
